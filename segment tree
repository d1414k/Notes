1. Segment tree is used for range query.(ex. max,min sum in range[5-20])
2. It takes O(n) time to create segment tree.
4. If we have n nums in an array and we want to create segment tree we need extra space to create this as follows
=> if n is power of 2 => n*2 -1
=> else (next power of 2)*2 - 1 
5. We will create above size array then call build method to create segment tree.
6. Segment tree will provide range query result in o(logn) times.( It will call at max 4 branches to get res so 4.logn => O(logn) )
